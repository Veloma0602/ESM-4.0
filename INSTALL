This INSTALL file describes how to build the ESM project. If you are
simply looking to use the ESM algorithm, then either add the following Maven 
dependency coordinates and repository configuration to your 
pom file (if you are using Maven):

<dependency>
  <groupId>edu.ucdenver.ccp</groupId>
  <artifactId>esm</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>

<repository>
  <id>bionlp-sourceforge</id>
  <url>http://bionlp.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bionlp/repo/</url>
</repository>

or, if you are not using Maven, download the ESM binary from 
http://bionlp.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bionlp/repo/edu/ucdenver/ccp/esm/1.0/esm-1.0.jar
and place it on your classpath.

Note: The ESM code requires Java version 6 or greater.

If you are interested in building the ESM project locally, please 
read on. There are at least two options for building the ESM project:

Option 1: Import the ESM into Eclipse as a Maven project. Included in 
          the distribution are the .project and .classpath files used by Eclipse
          to configure Eclipse projects. Once the ESM project has been
          imported into Eclipse, Run As --> Maven install will build the 
          project. Note, building Maven projects inside of Eclipse requires 
          installation of a plugin. For details see: 
                                     http://maven.apache.org/eclipse-plugin.html
                                      
Option 2: Build from the command line using Maven
           Requirements:
                         Apache Maven 3.0.3 (http://maven.apache.org/)
                         Java 1.6.x

           Inside the base esm/ directory, execute: mvn clean install

If you are not familiar with Maven, you can find the build artifacts 
(e.g. jar files, etc.) in the target/ directories inside the esm/target directory.
